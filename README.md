# NeuralNetwork-Examples
This repository includes three Jupyter notebooks demonstrating neural networks: one for image classification using Fashion MNIST, one for image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on Simpsons characters, and one for time series forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with temperature data.
